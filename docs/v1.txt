Why This SLC Works
Proves Core Value: Can people find and enjoy hidden spots?
Simple to Build: 4-6 weeks of development max
Easy to Test: Clear success/failure signals
Foundation for Growth: Everything else builds on this base
The key insight: Start with discovery, not features. If people don't love finding and visiting spots, no amount of advanced filtering or social features will save the app.
